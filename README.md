# Blog author interface

This project is part of the blog-api project by The Odin Project. In this app an author can manage their posts on my [blog-frontend](https://github.com/niconap/blog-frontend) project. The app will show the author their posts and it allows them to privatize/publicize their posts or delete them. The app also allows the author to create posts. 

In this app I used icons from the material.io website.
