# Blog author interface

### What this project?
This project is part of the blog-api project by The Odin Project. In this app an author can manage their posts on my [blog-frontend](https://github.com/niconap/blog-frontend) project. The app will show the author their posts and it allows them to privatize/publicize their posts or delete them. The app also allows the author to create posts. 

### How does it work?
A user has to create an author account to be able to publish posts on this blog. They'll need to provide their full name, a username and a password to sign up. After that posts can be created by clicking the plus icon on the dashboard. Once a post is created it can be publicized/privatized by clicking on the world/lock icon. Clicking on the title will show more details of the post and gives the user the option to edit the title and content of the post. It is also possible to delete any comments that were posted under the blog post. The author can also delete their account by using the button on the dashboard, but all posts need to be deleted first before the account can be deleted. 

### How was it made
This app was made using React and other npm packages (see the `package.json` file for all packages). In this app I also used icons from the material.io website, which can be found [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/). 

### Live version
The full API together with live versions of both the author and reader interface can be found [here](https://github.com/niconap/blog). This repository also contains the documentation of the API.
